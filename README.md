# Code-challenge1
// This program uses prompt() to get the user's input for the student marks, and then uses a series of if and else if statements to determine the corresponding grade based on the value of marks. The console.log() function is used to output the resulting grade to the console.Note that I've adjusted the ranges for the grades slightly to make them consistent with the prompt.


# challenge2 
The program starts by defining some constants for the speed limit, the number of demerit points per km over the limit, and the maximum number of demerit points allowed before the license is suspended. These constants can be adjusted as needed.The program then uses prompt() to get the speed of the car from the user. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, the program prints "Ok" and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the number of kilometers per hour over the speed limit and uses that to calculate the number of demerit points the driver should receive. I have used the Math.floor() function to round off the demerits points to the nearest integer.



challenge3
The program uses the const and console.log functions to determine the accuracy of the basic salary of the emloyee.
